# ðŸ“„ Resume Builder UI: Frontend Trial Task Submission

This project delivers the core **Frontend Component** for the next-generation Resume Building & Career Ecosystem, successfully meeting the trial task requirements for a modern UI and customization page.

The prototype is built with a **Backend-First** mindset, ensuring it is ready to integrate seamlessly with the company's proposed APIs and data validation modules.

## Project Vision and Key Features

The primary objective was to create a **dynamic, fully controllable editing tool** that goes far beyond a basic static template.

### 1. Advanced Hybrid Editing (Update & Read)

The editing experience is highly refined, combining two methods for optimal user workflow:

* **Direct-on-Resume Editing:** The user can **click directly on any single-line field** (Name, Dates, Titles, Institution) to update the text instantly.
* **Structured Form Editing:** Dedicated, organized text areas are provided in the left panel for **multi-line content** (Professional Summary, Project Descriptions, Achievements).

### 2. Full Data Control (CRUD: Create, Update, Delete)

The UI supports the complete data lifecycle for list-based sections (Education, Experience, Projects), demonstrating robust state management:

* **Create (Add New):** Clear **"Add New" buttons** allow the user to instantly append new structured entries to the resume.
* **Update:** All data fields are live-editable.
* **Delete:** Simple **"&times; Remove" buttons** are implemented next to entries in the side panel to delete unwanted items instantly.

### 3. Deep Customization and Integration Readiness

* **Full Styling Control:** The user can control the final design, including **five accent colors**, **three professional fonts**, and **two paper background options**.
* **Integration Showcase:** The design includes a **"Verified" badge** element, proving the UI is ready to consume status flags from the company's planned **Verification Modules**.

## Technical Implementation

* **Frontend Framework:** Next.js (with React hooks for state management).
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v3 and CSS Variables for modular, scalable theming.
* **Architecture:** Clean component architecture built to consume structured JSON data, confirming readiness to integrate with external APIs.
